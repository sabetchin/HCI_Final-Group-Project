                    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Remember that your child is always watching and learning from you. Take the time to model the behaviors and values that you want them to adopt, such as kindness, respect, and patience. And don't forget to show them love and affection every day. These small moments of connection can have a big impact on your child's emotional well-being and development.</p><br>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Avoid using harsh or physical punishment. Instead, use positive reinforcement and discipline as a teaching tool. Remember that your child's behavior is often a reflection of their emotions and needs, so take the time to understand what's really going on before reacting. And most importantly, always treat your child with kindness, respect, and empathy.</p>

             <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Parenting planning</h2>
             <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">parenting involves establishing clear roles and responsibilities for each parent, creating a schedule that works for both parents and children, communicating openly and honestly with your co-parent, considering the needs of your children, being flexible and willing to make adjustments as needed, and seeking support from professionals if needed. By working together with your co-parent and keeping your children's needs in mind, you can create a stable and supportive environment that promotes their healthy development. Remember to be patient and understanding with your children, and avoid using harsh words or physical punishment. Instead, focus on positive reinforcement and encouragement to help them learn and grow. With a clear plan in place, you can build a strong and positive relationship with your children that will last a lifetime.
